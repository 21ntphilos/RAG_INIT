The Age of Debt Bubbles is a book on monetary policy proposing that money creation through fractional-reserve banking makes the monetary system debt-based. The book argues that economic bubbles, higher unemployment, recessions, and depressions are caused by central banks relying on inverted yield curves and tight monetary policy.
