John Panonetsa Mangudya (born 5 October 1963) is a former governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. He was appointed in March 2014 by the then Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, and began his tenure as governor on 1 May that year. His second five year term ended on 28 March 2024. He succeeded Gideon Gono as the governor of Zimbabwe's central bank and became the nation's 6th substantial exchequer.


== Early life and education ==
Mangudya was born in the Mutambara area of Melsetter (now Chimanimani), in Manicaland Southern Rhodesia, the youngest of twelve children. His early schooling was disrupted by the Zimbabwean liberation war, prompting him to pursue his studies through correspondence courses at night with the Zimbabwe Distance College. Despite these challenges, he completed his A-levels and later earned a scholarship to the University of Zimbabwe, where he obtained a degree in accounting and economics. During his early career, Mangudya taught at St. Peter’s College in Highfield, where one of his students was Philip Chiyangwa, who later became a prominent Zimbabwean businessman and politician. After completing his degree, Mangudya’s talents attracted attention from multiple institutions, including the Air Force of Zimbabwe, the Central Intelligence Organisation, and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. Ultimately, he chose to join  the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.
Mangudya earned bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from the University of Zimbabwe, where he won several book prizes for his academic achievements. He also has a PhD in Economics from Washington International University.
He was on several boards before his appointment as Governor of the Reserve Bank. He was the chairperson of the Industrial Development Corporation of Zimbabwe and Agricultural Marketing Authority.


== Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governorship ==
Mangudya started work as RBZ governor on 1 May 2014 after being appointed into office by Robert Mugabe. He took over from Charity Dhliwayo who had been acting since November 2013 following Gideon Gono's retirement. In May 2019, his expired contract was renewed for a further 5 years by Emmerson Mnangagwa. He was succeeded by John Mushayavanhu in March 2024.


=== Bond notes and coins ===
A few months after assuming office, Mangudya introduced bond notes at that time stated not to be a currency, but a legal tender pegged to be with the same value as the US dollar. The bond coins were introduced to remedy a lack of small change. In November 2016, Mangudya also introduced bond notes, pegged at the same value as the US Dollar again The stated goal was to ease cash shortages and boost liquidity for small transactions. Initially, bond notes were accepted at par with the US Dollar, but their value quickly eroded on the parallel market, leading to widespread public distrust and accusations that they were a precursor to reintroducing the Zimbabwean Dollar—a claim Mangudya repeatedly refuted.


=== RTGS Dollar ===
The bond notes and  bond coins continued losing value against the US dollar on the parallel market and this led Mangudya to the introduce a new currency, the RTGS Dollar in February 2019. The RTGS dollar was introduced to bring sanity in the foreign currency market, promote diaspora remittances, protect foreign investments and exports.


=== Promotion of Electronic Payments ===
Faced with persistent cash shortages, Mangudya championed the shift toward a cashless economy by promoting electronic payment systems, including mobile money platforms like EcoCash and bank card transactions. In 2016, he reduced transaction fees for electronic payments to encourage adoption, arguing that this would reduce reliance on physical cash and improve monetary circulation. While the policy increased the use of digital transactions, it was undermined by infrastructure challenges, such as unreliable electricity and internet connectivity, and did not fully resolve liquidity issues.


=== Foreign Exchange Management ===
Mangudya implemented the Foreign Exchange Auction System in June 2020 to replace the fixed exchange rate regime, aiming to create a transparent and market-driven mechanism for allocating foreign currency. The system allowed businesses to bid for US Dollars through commercial banks, with the goal of curbing the black market and stabilizing the exchange rate. While the auction system initially narrowed the gap between official and parallel market rates, critics noted that limited foreign currency reserves and bureaucratic delays hampered its effectiveness, and the parallel market continued to thrive.


=== Monetary Policy Reforms ===
Mangudya worked to tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates and controlling money supply growth. In 2022, he introduced measures to curb speculative borrowing and reduce excess liquidity, including a significant hike in the policy rate to 200%—one of the highest in the world at the time. These steps aimed to combat inflation, which had soared above 500% in 2020. Inflation did decline in subsequent years, but economic analysts debated whether this was due to Mangudya’s policies or external factors like improved agricultural output.

== Personal life ==
Mangudya is married to Tapiwa Mangudya and they have three children. He is a member of the United Methodist Church.


=== Commonwealth Preferential Trade Agreements ===
John Mangudya played a significant role in negotiating Commonwealth free trade preferential trade agreements on behalf of Zimbabwe, particularly with the Commonwealth. He was instrumental in securing agreements for the supply of Zimbabwean sugar to Commonwealth nations, bolstering the country’s agricultural exports. Additionally, Mangudya facilitated the export of Zimbabwean beef to both Commonwealth countries and other markets under preferential trade terms, enhancing Zimbabwe’s position in international trade. During this period, he worked closely with then-British Prime Minister John Major, fostering diplomatic and economic ties between Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom.
Similarly, Zimbabwe’s sugar industry has contributed to Commonwealth trade through preferential agreements. Under the Sugar Protocol of the ACP-EU Cotonou Agreement, Zimbabwe secured a preferential tariff quota of 30,225  tonnes annually, supplemented by a variable Special Preferential Sugar quota. While this agreement primarily targeted the European Union, it included Commonwealth countries like the UK, which historically imported Zimbabwean sugar before and after its suspension from the Commonwealth in 2002. The sugar sector, centered in the Lowveld region, has leveraged fertile soils and irrigation to produce exportable surpluses, with companies like Tongaat Hulett driving output. Even after economic challenges in the 2000s, Zimbabwe maintained sugar exports, with potential markets in Commonwealth nations like South Africa and Zambia, though regional trade has often been overshadowed by EU focus.
Zimbabwe’s beef exports to Commonwealth markets waned in the early 2000s due to foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks, economic sanctions, and the land reform program, which disrupted commercial farming. However, a resurgence began in 2017, with efforts to revive the CSC and attract investment, such as the $130 million deal with UK-based Boustead Beef. Sugar exports have remained more consistent, supported by STABEX funds to stabilize earnings, reinforcing Zimbabwe’s role as a supplier to Commonwealth and global markets. Today, as Zimbabwe seeks to rejoin the Commonwealth (a process ongoing as of 2025), its beef and sugar industries are poised to reclaim their historical significance, supplying quality products to member states and beyond.


=== Project Finance and Infrastructure Development ===
Mangudya was involved in significant infrastructure initiatives in Zimbabwe. One notable project was the development of the Mazowe satellite, a telecommunications endeavor often mistakenly attributed to Japanese funding. In reality, the project  was financed through Afreximbank, where Mangudya’s influence as a board member played a pivotal role in securing the necessary resources. His work in this area underscored his commitment to advancing Zimbabwe’s technological and infrastructural capabilities.


=== Banking ===
Mangudya is widely regarded as a key figure in the country's financial sector. He began his career in 1986 as an economist at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe after completing his education. Mangudya later played a significant role in the establishment of the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), where Zimbabwe holds the position of the third-largest shareholder, following Nigeria and Egypt.
During his tenure with Afreximbank, Mangudya's efforts contributed to the creation of several indigenous banks in Zimbabwe. He facilitated loans and guarantees that supported these institutions as well as various Zimbabwean projects, including the Mazowe Satellite Station. Additionally, Mangudya is credited with devising the strategy that elevated Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe to its status as Zimbabwe's largest commercial bank. His innovative financial strategies have been noted for their role in sustaining Zimbabwe's economy during periods of severe sanctions and financial hardship, prompting suggestions for a new field of study termed "wartime economics" or "crisis reserve banking" to analyze his methods.
